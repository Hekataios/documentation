# Overview

## The Kalendar

The Kalendar is an event system to help players organize roleplay events and track participants. Events can be created/updated via the API.

They can be viewed either on the Kalendar front-end as a calendar/list view, on the Cartographer when they have a location defined, and are also available as a ICS flux that can be added to calendar clients (Proton, Outlook, Google calendar, ...). The flux are updated (usually calendar clients updates the flux once per day).

## Archives

Events, once concluded, are stored in archives. Players can also add comments to events that are over (especially things like event summary), that will be accessible in the timeline.
